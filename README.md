# LAN-Stack-Accelerator
General purpose quickstart repo for working with the LAN (Loopback, Angular 2, Node) stack.

The stack is standardized on Node v6.x, Loopback 3, and Angular2 v2.3.x.

This template is intended to faciliate developers quickly spooling up new LAN stack projects by simply cloning the repo, minmizing wasted resources on time-consuming and automatable dev-ops tasks.
