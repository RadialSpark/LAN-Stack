# LAN-Stack-Accelerator
General purpose quick-start repo for working with the LAN (Loopback, Angular 2, Node) stack.
This particular repo is to be used with monolithic, full-stack applications.

The stack is standardized on Node v6.x, Loopback 3, and Angular2 v2.3.x.

This template is intended to facilitate developers quickly spooling up new LAN stack projects by simply cloning the repo, minimizing wasted resources on time-consuming and automatable dev-ops tasks.
